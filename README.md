# Accident Detection Using Machine Learning

This project presents a real-time accident detection system leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system is designed to analyze dashcam video footage and identify potential accidents.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**  
  Processes dashcam video data frame-by-frame to identify accidents as they occur.

- **YOLOv8 Integration**  
  Utilizes the highly efficient YOLOv8 object detection model for accurate and fast inference.

- **Custom Dataset Training**  
  Model trained on a custom-labeled dataset, ensuring high precision in accident and non-accident classification.

- **OpenCV for Video Processing**  
  Employs OpenCV for robust video frame extraction and manipulation.

- **Video Output**  
  Generates output videos with detected accidents highlighted (e.g., with bounding boxes and labels).

## Results

The trained YOLOv8 model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying accident events within various dashcam video footages. The system provides near real-time detection, making it suitable for practical deployment in scenarios requiring immediate accident alerts.

The output includes processed videos with visual indicators (e.g., bounding boxes and labels) highlighting detected accidents.
